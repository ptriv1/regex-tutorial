# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email

Many websites require using an email and password to log in.  Since website owners need to confirm the email is real, programmers can add code to verify email addresses entered are in a certain format.  A relatively simple way to do this in JavaScript is to use a regular expression.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

In this gist I will describe a regular expression that allows verification of an email.

## Regex Components

This regular expression uses forward slashes (/) to enclose the expression. Since the regex is a literal, it needs to use these forward slashes.
